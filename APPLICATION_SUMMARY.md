          "type": "minimum",
          "field": "creditScore",
          "condition": "greater_than_or_equal",
          "value": 620,
          "description": "Minimum credit score of 620 required",
          "isRequired": true
        }
      ],
      "validationRules": [
        {
          "id": "validation-001",
          "name": "Credit Score Validation",
          "type": "field_validation",
          "condition": "creditScore >= 620",
          "message": "Credit score must be at least 620",
          "severity": "error"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],

  creditScore: 650,
  income: 75000,
  downPayment: 15000,
  debtToIncomeRatio: 0.35,
  propertyType: "Single Family",
  occupancy: "Primary Residence"
};

const result = validateMortgageApplication(application);
console.log("Is valid:", result.isValid);

7. **Multi-language Support**: Support for different languages
8. **Advanced Validation**: More sophisticated validation logic

## Conclusion

This application provides a complete solution for converting PDF mortgage rules into structured, usable code. It leverages the power of AI to understand complex business rules and convert them into production-ready TypeScript code that can be used to validate mortgage applications programmatically.

The generated code is type-safe, well-documented, and follows TypeScript best practices, making it suitable for integration into existing mortgage processing systems.
